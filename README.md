## Summary
Made for those who want to parse ```objdump --dwarf=decodedline <binary>``` dumps. A data structure called a `ObjDumpAddressMap` is made to parse such dumps and store the contents in memory for quick access. It can be treated as your typical ```std::map``` as if it were storing <address, `AddressInfo`> pairs. `AddressInfo` is a struct that stores a <line number, fileID> pair.

## Use case(s)
Originally, I wanted to write a tool that could measure thread contention in realtime and show you where those threads were located (relative to your code) but got blocked on translating a stack frame return address to a source code line number. If we can do `dump_addr = ret_addr - strt_addr + dump_offset` then we can perform a lookup on the decoded line dump and find the source file location. 

```go

func foo():
  bin = "/home/bob/test_bin"
  
  (strt_addr, end_addr, dump_offset) = parse_page_info("/proc/self/maps", bin).unpack()

  ObjDump::ObjDumpAddressMap addr_map("/home/bob/bin_dump.txt")

  frame_cnt = 5
  stack = backtrace(frame_cnt)
  for ret_addr in stack:
    dump_addr = ret_addr - strt_addr + dump_offset
    printf(
      dump_addr,
      addr_map[dump_addr].line_number,
      addr_map.get_path(addr_map[dump_addr].fileID)
    )
```
